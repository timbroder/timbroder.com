I was stuck in meetings most of the day but I was able to download the keynote
for the train ride home :)

Here are some thoughts. If I live tweeted, it probably would have gone
something like this. Maybe a few more here..

  * The dev intro video was awesome. It’s like Apple saying “We love you, we’ve heard you”
  * That’s a lot of Apple engineers present
  * It’s a shame I can’t risk my laptop. I want to play with Yosemite! I dig the
new look

  * Ooo dark mode
  * Mail drop is huge for work
  * Airdrop from phone to laptop!!
  * Proximity awareness is great for starting an email on the can and finishing it at the desk ;)
  * Proximity hotspot is PERFECT for when I’m on the train
  * Texts in Messages!!!!!
  * Proximity calls is crazy. Listening to music on laptop with headphones, call comes in, boom.
  * Hmm, maybe I’ll install the public beta…..

  * Interactive notifications, thank god. one of the few things still on my “I miss from Android list”
  * Context typing looks hot. I missed switfkey
  * I’m curious if Health can accurately track my sleep. But, I don’t want my device in bed with me
  * Family sharing and photo stream will be cool :) The purchases is great. Laura and I overlap on so many apps and games
  * I’m really curious what your iCloud size limit is going to be. Unlimited? It can store ALL your photos.  I wonder if people will be dumping photos into this from other services
  * Ah, there we go. Paid tiers. Will probably stick with Flickr for my ultimate backup. (All are also backed up to CrashPlan)
  * Hah, Shazam Siri. Nice

* 50 mins in the keynote for DEV

  * App store improvements are awesome. The lists, searches, App bundles. Apple LISTENED. wow. Whoa App preview videos
  * Ahh There’s Test Flight! And it’s free
  * Extensibility: Inter-app. boom.
  * Notification Center Widgets. boom
  * 3rd party keyboards. boom
  * Can’t wait for TouchID support in 1password
  * The user implications of HomeKit are nice. We have a WiMo so I’m on board with other home automation things
  * CloudKit. Boom. The cloud pricing wars were already insane. I’m worried about the performance and availability… Code once though…. I
  * The Metal demos are sick. I don’t do much of that type of gaming. Might be time to start again
  * Mentioning Objective-C. OMG
  * Swift. **BOOM. HOLY SHIT**. Closures, Generics, Namespaces
  * OMG the playground
  * Grabbing the book right now. It’s trending. Pretty cool
